    <h2>Catalytic Converter Shields</h2>
    
        
        <h3>Anti-Theft Devices</h3>
        <div>
            <p>   Catalytic converter theft has risen dramatically in the past few years.  
               The larger the converter, the higher its rare metal content and so the more value it has on the scrap market.  
               Commercial vehicles have some of the largest on the road. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>   
               In addition, most commercial vehicles sit off the ground high enough to where a jack isn't needed to easily access and remove the converter.  
               For the thieves, the time to slide under a truck and cut a cat loose can be under 1 minute.  
               If the environment is right for them, they can hit 10 vehicles in under half an hour, in and out.  
               Replacement of a commercial vehicle's catalytic converter can cost up to $3000, and when you combine the costs of getting it towed for repair, 
               and renting a replacement truck, the end cost can easily break $10,000 per cat stolen.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
               No theft device is undefeatable.  
               However, thieves by their very nature don't like to work and have a limited timeframe, 
               and because our shield is not only a good visual deterrent but a real practical deterrent as well, they are far more likely to go elsewhere for easier targets.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
               We've come up with a shield design and installation method that is not only a great visual deterrent, it greatly increases the amount of that it would take to steal a cat.  
               A thief armed with the usual battery powered sawzall, that same 30 minute scenario from above would drop it to 1-3 vehicles in a half hour, assuming they brought enough spare blades. 
               Our current design uses 11 gauge steel and fits 2015 and later Ford F59, F5K and F550 chassis,
               but we can build one to suit most any commercial vehicle using even heavier gauge steel if requested.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
               These are permanent fixtures, meant to be welded in place. 
               If you have a fleet of commercial vehicles that could benefit from greater protection, we may have the solution for you.  We can design, build, and install at your location.
